           <p>We examine how the supply of offenses respond to a large environmental shock in the urban space. We focus on blackouts which can abruptly change the provision of light, and potentially the distribution of criminal opportunities. Using high-frequency administrative data on more than 370,000 power outage incidents reported in Chile during 2014-2015, we analyze how they affect crime along several dimensions. We find no significant effect on the aggregate crime rate, but we also find two offsetting reactions driving this result: a positive effect in burglary, and a negative effect on robbery and thefts. By exploiting unique features of the data, we analyze several dimensions of treatment effect heterogeneity regarding the magnitude, size and duration of the blackout. In addition, we find that crime responses differ by municipality socio-economic status. We validate our findings by conducting a set of placebo exercises where we find no meaningful variation across different crime types and treatment definitions. Our results suggest that criminals react to changes in incentives by carrying out crimes that yield a higher expected return.</p>

           <p>Police departments around the world invest heavily on crime prevention technologies. In the US, virtually every local police department has a video-surveillance system in place or access to one. This paper studies a nationwide police video-surveillance policy implemented in Ecuador in 2012. By 2019, it had presence in over 45\% of parishes -- smallest administrative unit in the country -- within all provinces and surveilled over 30\% of all urban space. The gradual rollout of the policy across time and space allows us to estimate its short and medium-term effect on crime. We use (i) maps representing urban centers, and unique georeferenced administrative data on the (ii) universe of reported crimes to the police -- 447k incidents -- and (iii) emergency calls made to the 911 system -- 2.2m calls -- to construct a panel at the city block-month level. Our spatial design allows us to exploit variation in proximity to installation sites to estimate potential displacement effects. We find that on aggregate cameras decreased crimes by around 12\%. However, that aggregate masks two opposing effects: a decrease within surveilled blocks and displacement to unsurveilled blocks. We also find that the effects are concentrated within poor, more populated, and urban settings. Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation our result suggests a drop of around 5.8k less reported crimes in a given year. Our findings indicate that video-surveillance systems can be an effective city-level crime prevention policy especially within contexts where policing is costly and challenging.</p>
